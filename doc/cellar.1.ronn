cellar(1) - bottle management tool for WINE connoisseurs
========================================================

## SYNOPSIS

`cellar` [-dv] [-b <bottle>] [--] <command> <subargs>

## DESCRIPTION

`cellar` is a tool for managing WINE bottles. `cellar` arguments are divided like this:

 * First, [GLOBAL OPTIONS][] are processed. These control things like program verbosity, which bottle to use,
   and other settings that are relevant no matter what you're doing.
 * Second, cellar takes a [COMMAND](#COMMANDS), and that command probably has its own set of arguments and flags.
   TCLAP is generally used as the command line parser, which provides a -- argument to separate the command from
   the global options (e.g. `cellar -v -- create bottlename`). If the program seems to be interpreting a flag
   ambiguously, try this first.

## GLOBAL OPTIONS

 * `-v`, `--verbose`:
    Enable verbose output.

 * `-d`, `--dryrun`:
    Don't actually do anything, just print what you would do. Implies `--verbose`.

 * `-b`, `--bottle <bottlename>`:
    Specify that you want to use the bottle named <bottlename>, instead of the one activated with the "cellar activate"
    command.

## COMMANDS

TODO: Generate this.
