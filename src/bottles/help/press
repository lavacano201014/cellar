cellar press [<options>] <installer>

Presses an installer into the wine bottle, first by copying the installer to
~/.local/share/cellar/pressed, then running it in the wine bottle.

Options:
  -n  Don't actually execute the installer, just press it. This is useful for
      preparing existing WINE bottles to be corked.
