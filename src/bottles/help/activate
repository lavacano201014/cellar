cellar activate <bottle>

Marks a given WINE bottle as "active". <bottle> can be one of the following:
 - An absolute path, or a relative path (prefixed with "./")
 - A simple string, which is assumed to be a suffix for a cellar-managed WINE
   bottle. For instance, "cellar activate example" would set the active WINE
   bottle to "~/.wine.example".
 - As above, with the ".wine." prefix. cellar will accept this, but will throw
   warnings about it.
