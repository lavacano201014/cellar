cellar uncork <bottle>

Uncorks a bottle, based on the configuration for <bottle> saved in
~/.local/share/cellar by a previous cork command.

Specifically, and in order:
 - First, the wine bottle is generated at ~/.wine.<bottle>
 - Then, the configuration is copied to the directory as "cellar.json"
 - If the configuration has any winetricks saved, cellar will rerun them
   automatically.
 - If the configuration references any pressed installers, cellar will run
   those in the new wine bottle as well.

Effectively, "uncorking" a bottle regenerates it from a saved configuration.
