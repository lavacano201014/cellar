cellar create <bottle>

Creates a WINE bottle, if a template exists. Or, if asked to create the
template bottle, does so, either by copying the existing bottle at ~/.wine
or asking WINE to generate a new one.

The template bottle can otherwise be treated the same as any other bottle,
e.g. specified by the global -b argument.
